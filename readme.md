Snowtooth GraphQL API üèî
===============
Snowtooth Mountain is a fake ski resort, but that shouldn't prevent it from having a real GraphQL API.

You write queries at the project website using GraphQL Playground: http://snowtooth.moonhighway.com. To view a list of all of the available queries, mutations, and subscriptions, click the __Schema__ tab on the right side of the screen.

Running the Project Locally üö°

To run the project locally, follow these instructions:

### Basic Setup
1. Download/clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies.
3. View [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) running on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Adding Apollo Engine
Want to integrate with [Apollo Engine](https://www.apollographql.com/engine)? Follow these instructions:
1. Create a [free Apollo Engine account](https://engine.apollographql.com/login).
2. Get an Apollo Engine Key.
3. Create a `.env` file and put it at the root of the project.
4. In the `.env` file, add the following line:

```

Then shred on some lift and trail data from the greatest fake ski resort on Earth! ‚õ∑

Caveats üö†
----
This is a demo app to allow students of [Moon Highway](https://www.moonhighway.com) or [GraphQL Workshop](https://www.graphqlworkshop.com) courses to start working with GraphQL. It updates the database (JSON files) each time someone sends a mutation, so some inconsistencies may appear if multiple people are running mutations at the same time.
